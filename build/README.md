## SDK Source Code Generation

The SDK is automatically regenerated and published from the API's definition after each API release. For more information on the build process, see the [platform-client-sdk-common](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/platform-client-sdk-common) project.


## Versioning

The SDK's version is incremented according to the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/). The decision to increment version numbers is determined by [diffing the Platform API's swagger](https://github.com/purecloudlabs/platform-client-sdk-common/blob/master/modules/swaggerDiff.js) for automated builds, and optionally forcing a version bump when a build is triggered manually (e.g. releasing a bugfix).


## Support

This package is intended to be forwards compatible with v2 of Genesys Cloud's Platform API. While the general policy for the API is not to introduce breaking changes, there are certain additions and changes to the API that cause breaking changes for the SDK, often due to the way the API is expressed in its swagger definition. Because of this, the SDK can have a major version bump while the API remains at major version 2. While the SDK is intended to be forward compatible, patches will only be released to the latest version. For these reasons, it is strongly recommended that all applications using this SDK are kept up to date and use the latest version of the SDK.

For any issues, questions, or suggestions for the SDK, visit the [Genesys Cloud Developer Forum](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/forum/).
