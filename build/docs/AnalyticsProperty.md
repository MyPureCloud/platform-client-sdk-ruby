**The Ruby SDK is deprecated as of 9/16/2020**

The Genesys Cloud Ruby SDK (v96.0.0) will be frozen at its current version level. Any new enhancements to our API or bug fixes will not be backported. If you do need to take advantage of new features or bug fixes outside the Genesys Cloud Ruby SDK, you will need to use the Genesys Cloud REST endpoints directly. More information can be found in the [Official Announcement](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/forum/t/announcement-genesys-cloud-ruby-sdk-end-of-life/8850).

## Properties

|Name | Type | Description | Notes|
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **property_type** | **String** | Indicates what the data type is (e.g. integer vs string) and therefore how to evaluate what would constitute a match | |
| **property** | **String** | User-defined rather than intrinsic system-observed values. These are tagged onto segments by other components within PureCloud or by API users directly.  This is the name of the user-defined property. | |
| **value** | **String** | What property value to match against | |
